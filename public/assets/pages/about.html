<h3>About me</h3>
<p>
  I am currently a student studying Web and Mobile Development however I have
  been doing this for a long time, lets start from the beginning...
</p>
<p>
  My first interaction with anything related to code was a HTML lesson
  in secondary shool in year 9 (13 years old), after that I took computer
  science as an option at school and started to learn python, I found this came
  easy to me and after a short amount of time I was completing the class tasks
  as quickly as i could to work on something I wanted to code. I remember one
  program I spent a long time on was a simple brute force password cracker, it
  would be useless against any modern systems but I saw a purpose in it unlike
  the other work I was doing.
</p>

  Around about this time I started to experiment with coding in my own time and
  started looking online for tutorials. I ended up writing plugins for Minecraft
  and even made some money from them at the time at this point I didn't really
  understand what was happening as I now know I would of been calling on an API
  to do what I wanted however I was building the logic in myself. This was done
  in Java which was a very different experiece to my python programming
  experience and forced me to learn about classes and object oriented
  programming. This was all around the same time meaning I was around 15 by this
  point. After my interest in the game faded the coding slowed down and I moved
  to new technologies.
</p>

  My next programming endevour was my most optimistic of all. I was going to
  learn how to make websites. I remember my first project was a forum system
  with user accounts and interactions. I used PHP and SQL to build my website
  not realising how big of a project it really was. I was using simple
  techniques like session cookies however I didn't know any better and wanted to
  make something that just worked. Around this time a service that I used to
  listen to music with friends was about to shut down and I wanted to create my
  own version to use, this service was called plug.dj, I never finished my
  version of it but I learned probably the most I ever have developing a web app
  during that process. I remember spending the entire summer working on it, I
  used a youtube API to fetch search queries and display them in a custom ui,
  allow them to be added to playlists or added to a public room queue. This
  process made sure I was excellent at understanding and interpreting json data
  along with making me aware of different http request types. During this
  project I also created a working live chat, I used node for the first time to
  create this through the use of web sockets, I also used the same node server
  to sync up users so their youtube videos would play at exactly the same time.
  At this time I will have been approaching 16 and looking back, understanding
  so much at that age is quite impressive.

  Unfortunately up to this point I had still not bagan to use git to backup my
  projects meaning that they were eventually lost to a faied harddrive.
