<p>
  I am currently a student studying Web and Mobile Development however I have
  been doing this for a long time, lets start from the beginning...

<h3>Coding History</h3>
<p>
  My first interaction with anything related to code was a HTML lesson in
  secondary shool in year 9 (13 years old), after that I took computer science
  as an option at school and started to learn python, I found this came easy to
  me and after a short amount of time I was completing the class tasks as
  quickly as i could to work on something I wanted to code. I remember one
  program I spent a long time on was a simple brute force password cracker, it
  would be useless against any modern systems but I saw a purpose in it unlike
  the other work I was doing.
</p>
<p>
  Around about this time I started to experiment with coding in my own time and
  started looking online for tutorials. I ended up writing plugins for Minecraft
  and even made some money from them at the time at this point I didn't really
  understand what was happening as I now know I would of been calling on an API
  to do what I wanted however I was building the logic in myself. This was done
  in Java which was a very different experiece to my python programming
  experience and forced me to learn about classes and object oriented
  programming. This was all around the same time meaning I was around 15 by this
  point. After my interest in the game faded the coding slowed down and I moved
  to new technologies.
</p>
<p>
  My next programming endevour was my most optimistic of all. I was going to
  learn how to make websites. I remember my first project was a forum system
  with user accounts and interactions. I used PHP and SQL to build my website
  not realising how big of a project it really was. I was using simple
  techniques like session cookies however I didn't know any better and wanted to
  make something that just worked. Around this time a service that I used to
  listen to music with friends was about to shut down and I wanted to create my
  own version to use, this service was called plug.dj, I never finished my
  version of it but I learned probably the most I ever have developing a web app
  during that process. I remember spending the entire summer working on it, I
  used a youtube API to fetch search queries and display them in a custom ui,
  allow them to be added to playlists or added to a public room queue. This
  process made sure I was excellent at understanding and interpreting json data
  along with making me aware of different http request types. During this
  project I also created a working live chat, I used node for the first time to
  create this through the use of web sockets, I also used the same node server
  to sync up users so their youtube videos would play at exactly the same time.
  At this time I will have been approaching 16 and looking back, understanding
  so much at that age is quite impressive.
</p>
<p>
  During the project I looked into a lot of authentication standards at the
  time, I read around and eventually settled to use JSON Web Tokens, this was
  due to the ability to have information avaliable on the client side from the
  token without having to fetch it every time from the server such as the acount
  name and so forth. This system was good and since it was transferable between
  different languages and servers it was a much better alternative than php
  session cookies which I had been using previously since these could not be
  shared easily.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately up to this point I had still not bagan to use git to backup my
  projects meaning that they were eventually lost to a faied harddrive. However
  I still remembered the lessons I learned which was the main objective for me
  anyway.
</p>
<p>
  With starting college at 16 I did an A Level in computer science. In this
  class I learned a lot about the theory behind computer systems which gave me a
  better understanding of how the code I wrote was used by the computers that
  were running it. I did not excel at this however I learned the principles
  which help me in my coding.
</p>
<p>
  For my final year project in college I created a scheduling system designed to
  create a list of tasks for students set by teachers. The process of this
  tought me a lot about writing APIs and dealing with relational databases as
  this project relied heavily on data. The app was written in php with a
  javascript client running in a web browser which also concreted by knowledge
  of API based systems on the web.
</p>
<p>
  After college I didn't quite know if I wanted to go to University after not
  getting the results I expected and applied for an apprenticeship with IBM, I
  got through the initial tests and got invited into an assessment centre
  however I declined the offer as by that point I had decided to go to
  university and had a place at the University Of Sunderland.
</p>
<p>
  Once I had started uni I started conceptualizing Volume, my fitness tracker
  app. This was a huge project and in hindsight, I wasnt ready and didn't plan
  it very well. I started it and gave up planty of times and eventually left it
  for another day.
</p>
<p>
  In Jan 2019 I took part in the Global Game Jam, I had no idea how to make a
  game however I also had no plans for the weekend so I turned up and thankfully
  met some people who did know how to make one. I told them what I could do and
  i ended up coding the core game mechanics as I was knowledgable with code. I
  learned how to link it to all of the assets that the team were making and
  learned a lot over the weekend.
</p>
<p>
  Following this I started to make my own small games to challenege myself
  however, I did this in an environment that was more farmiliar to me. In the
  Game Jam the team had used unity and therefore I was coding in c#, I spent
  time working on games made in HTML canvas using Javascript. I first built a
  simple replica of the chrome dino game and later created a snake game which
  moved in the direction of the mouse rather than using a grid with arrow keys.
</p>
<p>
  After my first year of Uni had came to a close I set my mind on creating the
  Volume app that I had had the idea for at the begining of Uni. This time I
  followed development principles I had learned in some of my lectures, rapid
  prototyping, I promised myself that I would make something that worked and
  ignore all of the small features I had ideas for. After frameworking and
  building the tracker I had finally got something that worked and did some
  basic tracking which I could build upon.
